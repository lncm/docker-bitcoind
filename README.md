This repo builds [`bitcoind`] in an [auditable way](https://github.com/lncm/docker-bitcoind), and packages it into a minimal Docker containers provided for various CPU architectures.

> The work here was initially based on [ruimarinho/docker-bitcoin-core](https://github.com/ruimarinho/docker-bitcoin-core/), but has significantly diverged since.


#### Details

* **All [`git-tags`]** <small>(and most commits)</small> **are signed** by `D8CA1776EB9265491D07CE67F546ECBEA809CB18`
* **All [`git-tags`]** <small>(and most commits)</small> **are [`opentimestamps`]-ed**
* **All builds aim to be maximally auditable.**  After `git tag push`, the entire process is automated, with each step printed, and the code aiming to be easy to follow
* All builds are based on [Alpine]
* Cross-compiled builds are done using our (also auditable) [`qemu`]
* To fit build and complete `make check` test suite, BerkeleyDB is build separately [here]
* Each build produces binaries for: `amd64`, `arm64v8`, and `arm32v7`
* All architectures are aggregated under an easy-to-use [Docker Manifest]
* All [`git-tags`] are [build automatically], and with an [auditable trace]
* Each successful build of a `git tag` pushes result Docker image to [Docker Hub]
* Images pushed to Docker Hub are never deleted (even if `lnd` version gets overridden, previous one is preserved)
* All `final` images are based on Alpine for minimum base size
* All binaries are [`strip`ped]
* Each `git-tag` build is tagged with a unique tag number
* Each _minor_ version is stored in a separate directory (for the ease of backporting patches)

> **NOTE:** ZMQ `block` and `tx` ports are set to `28332` and `28333` respectively. 


## Tags

> **NOTE:** For an always up-to-date list see: https://hub.docker.com/r/lncm/bitcoind/tags

* `v0.20.0`
* `v0.19.1`
* `v0.19.0.1`
* `v0.18.1`
* `v0.17.2`
* `v0.16.3`
* `v0.15.2`


## Usage

### Pull

First pull the image from [Docker Hub]:

```bash
docker pull lncm/bitcoind:v0.20.0
```

> **NOTE:** Running above will automatically choose native architecture of your CPU.

[Docker Hub]: https://hub.docker.com/r/lncm/bitcoind

Or, to pull a specific CPU architecture:

```bash
docker pull lncm/bitcoind:v0.20.0-arm64v8
```

#### Start

Then to start bitcoind, run:

```bash
docker run  -it  --rm  --detach \
    -v ~/.bitcoin:/data/.bitcoin \
    -p 8332:8332 \
    -p 8333:8333 \
    -p 28332:28332 \
    -p 28333:28333 \
    --name bitcoind \
    lncm/bitcoind:v0.20.0
```

That will run bitcoind such that:

* all data generated by the container is stored in `~/.bitcoin` **on your host machine**,
* port `8332` will be reachable for the RPC communication,
* port `8333` will be reachable for the peer-to-peer communication,
* port `28332` will be reachable for ZMQ **block** notifications,
* port `28333` will be reachable for ZMQ **transaction** notifications,
* created container will get named `bitcoind`,
* within the container, `bitcoind` binary is run as unprivileged user `bitcoind` (`UID=1000`),
* that command will run the container in the background and print the ID of the container being run.


#### Interact

To issue any commands to a running container, do:

```bash
docker exec -it bitcoind BINARY COMMAND
```

Where:
* `BINARY` is either `bitcoind`, `bitcoin-cli`, `bitcoin-tx`, (or `bitcoin-wallet` on `v0.18+`) and
* `COMMAND` is something you'd normally pass to the binary   

Examples:

```bash
docker exec -it bitcoind bitcoind --help
docker exec -it bitcoind bitcoind --version
docker exec -it bitcoind bitcoin-cli --help
docker exec -it bitcoind bitcoin-cli -getinfo
docker exec -it bitcoind bitcoin-cli getblockcount
```

#### Troubleshooting

##### Bitcoind isn't starting

Here are some possible reasons why.

###### Permissions for the bitcoin data directory is not correct

The permissions for the bitcoin data direct is assumed to be UID 1000 (first user). 

If you have a different setup, please do the following

```bash
# where ".bitcoin" is the data directory
sudo chown -R 1000.1000 $HOME/.bitcoin
```
